# treeTraversal

Very Simple examples of tree traversal with custom implementation.

## Why?

* Most of the examples given on the internet assuming a binary tree, which only 2 child nodes.
* For the tasks of game AI where there might be many more possible state, it is not very useful.
* Hence this is an example for my future reference to navigate through different states of games.

## Applications
* Zero sum games

## Pseudocome
* From Russel and Norvich (AI)
